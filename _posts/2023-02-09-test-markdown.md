I used to remind myself during quarantine what Socrates told to someone whose mood did not improve by traveling:
“Why do you wonder that globe-trotting does not help you, seeing that you always take yourself with you? The reason which set you wandering is ever at your heels.”

And use this phrase to consolidate myself because I was not traveling that much, but tried to improve myself with reading. I was quite suspicious of how much traveling can improve someone. "Being at a certain place does not change or improve you in any way", I used to say to myself.

But after a trip in Slovenia I realized something new about traveling. When we stay in a place with the same people for too long we tend to comply with the image of ourselves that they have in their minds. And this is why traveling is important in my opinion. We meet people that have no bias or preconceived notion of who we are. They dont restrict us by putting us in a box and this helps us grow and discover suppressed parts of ourselves.

This is how traveling changes us. Not necessary by the things we see, but by meeting people that let us grow.
Our closest people have an idea of who we are that at the end of the day is only partial or has stagnated and cannot change.
Others know another part of ourselves. 
This in why when I meet rude people I always remind myself that maybe in their families they are known as the most caring and loving people. 
We have only seen a small side of them
