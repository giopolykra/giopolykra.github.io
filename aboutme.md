I was born in Cyprus but grew up in Athens. I have Italian roots from Florence.
I love reading books, cooking, playing the harmonica and learning new skills.

## Passions

#### Running
I enjoy this solitary meditative activity and I know I can always fall back to if I want to improve my mood. I am quite particular on how much I want to have run in a week and I will always find some time to do so. 
Though not quite ready yet I want to run ultramarathons in the future.

#### Scuba diving
I discovered scuba diving while in Cyprus and within a year as my ambitions and love for the sport grew, I begun diving with Global Underwater Explorers. 
I plan to get the DPV and drysuit certification this year and  slowly transition into technical diving  in the future, With the end goal to participate in exploration projects (caves and wrecks) and ghost-net retrieval projects with the Ghost Diving team.

#### Freediving
I am also passionate about freediving and in the process of getting my AIDA 3 certification, but due to recent setbacks due to surgeries this dicipline will have to wait a bit.

#### Sailing
I starter the ISSA Offshore Skipper course with the sole intention of fighting my sea sickness.

## Hobbies I have tried and want to do more regularly

#### Fencing
I was a bit prejudiced about this, because I preffer no but after I tried 

#### Climbing
I have only done bouldering but I really want to climb outdoor and one day maybe do some multipitch routes.

## Things I Want to Do in the Future

#### Rebreather Diving
The silent, bubble free way of diving. 

#### Paragliding
The cheapest way to get your feet of the gound. This sport has aged much better than hang gliding especially since the invention of the speed flying with miniwings. I definitely want to start this sport. 

#### Skydiving 
Skydiving is in the family. I remember going with my father to the Megara dropzone in Athens where he did his AFF course. He stopped after 50 jumps thought. I plan to continue the tradition and move to 200+ jumps because then is when the real fun starts ...

#### Airplane Pilot licence
Ever since I id some demo flights when I was 16 I am thinking of the time when I will be able to fly a plane on my own. Getting the  LAPL and then the PPL licence is on the to-do list!

#### Camper traveling while searching for climbing spots
Because why not?
